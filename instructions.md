- create an api route named "extract" which takes formData value of "url"
- the api checks if the url is a valid website page and returns an error if it is invalid
- if the url is valid it uses puppeteer or cheerio to extract the texts from that page. It should extract up to 2800 chracters of text at maximum.
- then the api return the text in the format of { text: string }
- then in the LinkTab component when the extract button is clicked. Use the url to make a call to /api/extract and then store it to analysis state in the global store.
- finally use the isExtracting and extractionStatus to update the indicator based on if the api request request was successful or not.
