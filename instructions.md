- I want to create a reviews page user interface similar the attached image.
- A review will have a "name", "jobTitle", "rating", "review", "image", and "replies".
- "replies" is an array of reply.
- A reply has a "name" = string, and a "reply" = string.
- "image" is an optional field.
- "rating" will be from 1 to 5.
- A user can leave multiple reviews.
- A reply can only be made by a user with an "admin" role.
- I also want to show at the top of all the reviews the total review count
- Make sure to seperate parts into different components if possible.
- Display the first 10 review then add a button at the bottom that says "show more".
- when the "show more" button is clicked display 5 more reviews and so on.
